# _Episode-07 Finding the Path_

## 1: What are various ways to add a images into our app? Explain with code examples.
There are two main ways to import React images:
- using the `import` statement
- using the `require` function

The `import` statement is a standard ES6 (ECMAScript 6) feature that allows developers to include dependencies in their code. The `require` function is a commonJS feature that allows developers to include resources in their application dynamically at runtime.

To display a react image that is hosted on an external server in a React component, you can use the <img> HTML tag inside a component's render method. For example:
``````
return (
    <img
        src="https://example.com/images/image.jpg"
        alt="Description of the Image"
    />
)
``````

Import Images with React Using the Import Statement.
``````
import Logo from './images/react-logo.png'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={Logo} alt="React Logo" />
    </div>
  )
}
``````

Import Images with React Using the require() Function.
``````
let Logo = require('./images/scaler-logo.png')

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={Logo} alt="React Logo" />
    </div>
  )
}

or

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={require('./images/scaler-logo.png')} alt="React Logo" />
    </div>
  )
}
``````
## 2: What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
If we do `console.log(useState())`, we get an array `[undefined, function]` where first item in the array is `state` value which is `undefined` and the second item in the array is `setState` a `function` which is bound to dispatchSetState.

## 3: How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array?
_Syntax of `useEffect` is:_
``````
useEffect(() => {}, []);
``````
`Case 1:` When the `dependency array is not included` in the arguments of `useEffect() hook`, the callback function will be `executed every time` the component is rendered and re-rendered.
``````
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I run everytime when this component is rendered and re-rendered")
});
``````
`Case 2:` When the `dependency array is empty` in the arguments of `useEffect() hook`, the callback function will be executed `only once` during the initial render of the component.
``````
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I Only run once (When the component gets mounted)")
}, []);
``````
`Case 3:` When the `dependency array contains a condition`, the callback function will be executed `one time` during the initial render of the component and also re-renderd if there is a `change in that condition`.
``````
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I run every-time when my condition is changed")
}, [condition]);
``````
## 4: What is SPA?
A `Single-Page Application` is an application that loads a `single HTML page` and all the necessary assets (such as JavaScript and CSS) required for the application to run, `dynamically updates` the webpage with data from web server `without reloading/refreshing` the entire page. All the HTML, CSS, JS are retrieved in the `initial load` and other data/resources can be loaded dynamically whenever required.

## 5: What is the difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
In `Server-side routing or rendering (SSR)`, every change in URL, http request is made to server to fetch the webpage, and replace the current webpage with the older one.

In `Client-side routing or rendering (CSR)`, during the first load, the webapp is loaded from server to client, after which whenever there is a change in URL, the router library navigates the user to the new page without sending any request to backend. All `Single Page Applications uses client-side routing`.
